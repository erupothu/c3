It is predominantly a self-employed security sector so reputation and recommendation is everything. There are very few full-time jobs in Close Protection where you are a career employee by either an individual principal client or company. Provided a licence holder remains flexible and diverse in the security roles he or she is willing to offer employers, career opportunities are plentiful.</p>\n<p>\n	Wages vary considerably depending on the assignment (length and location) and a licence holder&#39;s experience. As a general guide to pay a Close Protection team member in the UK could earn anything between about &pound;120 to &pound;200 per day with a team leader earning up to &pound;350. In hostile or remote environments abroad, wages have dropped significantly to approximately &pound;150 to &pound;300 per day subject to experience and the individual assignment. Some large security companies now offer a fixed short-term annual salary of about &pound;50000. Close Protection Team leaders would earn a little more up to about &pound;65,000.</p>\n<p>\n	Anubis only employ SIA licensed Close Protection Operatives (CPO&#39;s) and naturally favour those individuals that they have personally trained. This is because even if an individual holds an SIA Close Protection licence the variation in a company&#39;s training standards and the ultimate quality of successful graduates is huge. Increasingly the quality of the training provider and the individuals who actually trained the SIA licence holder is becoming a key factor in current Close Protection employment. Best-practice has yet to filter down to be delivered by all Close Protection training providers and until it does employers will continue to ask two questions namely:</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;Do you hold an SIA Close Protection licence?&quot; &amp; &quot;Who trained you?&quot;</p>\n<p>\n	The answer to the second question can often be more important than the first! An SIA licence is the current legal requirement to work on a contract in England, Wales &amp; Scotland, but it does not yet guarantee that the holder is a high-quality operator.</p>\n<p>\n	Before accepting any Close Protection employment you must always read the small print and clarify the position regarding travelling expenses, accommodation, food, leave payment, illness, insurance, repatriation, home visits, phone allowance, etc.</p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n	Security Consultants</h2>\n<p>\n	Currently the role of a Security Consultant is not a sector licensed by the SIA although a further announcement on this issue is expected by 2010. Employment therefore still relies on competency mainly judged by an individual&#39;s background and experience. As regulation draws closer and private security companies focus more on their legal &#39;duty of care&#39;, much more emphasis is being placed on formal qualifications like a security-related University Degree or the Anubis Certified Security Consultant (CSC) level 5 qualification.</p>\n<p>\n	Employment opportunities for Security Consultants varies widely and is difficult to quantify. They range from those that are in full-time employment with a risk management company like Anubis, to those that rely on contractual work from a range of organisations as a self-employed person. The organisations that employ Security Consultants are diverse and include such industry sectors as oil and gas, governments, defence, maritime, nuclear, construction and aviation. The Anubis CSC Course is accredited by the Institute of Risk Management and it may be worth undertaking broader research into qualifications and employment at:</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"http://www.theirm.org\">www.theirm.org</a></p>\n<p>\n	Provided a license holder remains flexible and diverse in the security roles he or she is willing to offer employers, career opportunities are plentiful. You can search online for <a href=\"http://www.jobisjob.co.uk/security/jobs\">security jobs</a> to get an idea of what&#39;s available in your area.</p>\n','published',8,9,'2012-01-20 16:46:02','2012-01-24 14:15:29'),(8,2,'Training','/training','<h1>\n	Training</h1>\n<p>\n	Anubis was formed in 2005 by the current Executive Directors who all possess credible training backgrounds and have proven track-records in the police, armed services and civilian environments. Although the company was created to provide a wide range of security services far beyond just training, it was undoubtedly a key foundation stone driven by a passionate desire to raise standards and skills in the private security industry. That founding desire and drive continues even today, and is best illustrated by the fact that all the company directors are members of various important SIA, University and Skills for Security Boards and Expert Groups.</p>\n<p>\n	Additionally all Anubis teaching staff possess current operational experience and benefit from civilian training qualifications. The combination of instructor competency gained over many decades in different training environments has helped shape our high-quality training courses with great currency, breadth and depth.</p>\n<p>\n	Anubis now offers a range of training courses accredited by some of the best organisations in the United Kingdom. A visit to the &#39;COURSES&#39; page of this website will provide further information on our accreditations and the courses currently available.</p>\n','published',12,21,'2012-01-20 16:46:36','2012-01-24 14:12:45'),(9,2,'Operations','/operations','<h1>\n	Operations</h1>\n','published',22,27,'2012-01-20 16:46:49',NULL),(10,2,'Security Management','/security-management','<h1>\n	Security Management</h1>\n','published',23,24,'2012-01-20 16:47:28',NULL),(11,2,'Personal Security','/personal-security','<h1>\n	Personal Security</h1>\n','published',25,26,'2012-01-20 16:48:01',NULL),(12,1,'Technical Equipment','/technical-equipment','<h1>\n	Technical Equipment</h1>\n<p>\n	overview text will go in here.\n</p>\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"/product\">Example Product Listing</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"/product/test\">Example Product Item</a></li>\n</ul>\n','published',30,31,'2012-01-20 16:56:33','2012-01-31 11:39:04'),(13,1,'Training','/training','<h1>\n	Training</h1>\n<p>\n	information about the training section here. &nbsp;child pages to the left.\n</p>\n','published',32,41,'2012-01-20 16:56:51','2012-01-31 11:37:30'),(14,2,'Contact Us','/contact-us','<h1>\n	Contact Us</h1>\n<p>\n	Please use the form below to get in touch with us, ask us any particular questions, or just to register your interest in Anubis.\n</p>\n<p>\n	<widget contenteditable=\"false\" method=\"form\" module=\"contact\">[C3 Contact Form]</widget>\n</p>\n','published',43,48,'2012-01-20 16:57:31','2012-01-26 09:54:17'),(15,2,'Map & Directions','/map-and-directions','<h1>\n	Map and Directions</h1>\n<p>\n	Anubis House<br />\n	Whitestone Business Park<br />\n	Hereford<br />\n	HR1 3SE\n</p>\n<p>\n	Tel: 01432 851656\n</p>\n<p>\n	~~googlemap? will go in here~~\n</p>\n','published',44,45,'2012-01-25 16:13:17',NULL),(16,2,'Company Regulatory Information','/information','<h1>\n	Company Regulatory Information</h1>\n<p>\n	<strong>Full Company Name</strong>:&nbsp; Anubis Associates Limited<br />\n	<strong>Company Registration Number</strong>:&nbsp; 05629438<br />\n	<strong>Registered Address</strong>:&nbsp; Anubis House, Whitestone Business Park, Hereford, HR1 3SE<br />\n	<strong>Main Email Address</strong>: admin@anubisltd.com<br />\n	<strong>VAT Registration Number</strong>:&nbsp; 869 8261 63<br />\n	<strong>Data Protection Registration Number</strong>:&nbsp; Z1178771\n</p>\n','published',46,47,'2012-01-25 16:15:00',NULL),(17,2,'CP Course','/cp-course','<h1>\n	CP Course</h1>\n<p>\n	Information here.\n</p>\n','published',13,14,'2012-01-26 11:22:19',NULL),(18,2,'CSC Course','/csc-course','<h1>\n	CSC Course</h1>\n<p>\n	Information here.\n</p>\n','published',15,16,'2012-01-26 11:22:54',NULL),(19,2,'FAQs','/faqs','<h1>\n	FAQs</h1>\n<p>\n	FAQ page.\n</p>\n','published',17,18,'2012-01-26 11:23:14',NULL),(20,2,'Case Studies','/case-studies','<h1>\n	Case Studies</h1>\n<p>\n	Case studies.\n</p>\n','published',19,20,'2012-01-26 11:23:46',NULL),(21,2,'Privacy Policy','/legal/privacy','<h1>\n	Privacy Policy</h1>\n<p>\n	Your privacy is important to us.
